## Covid Cases Tracker
Plotting Coronavirus Cases On World Map - Interactive Dashboard Using JavaScript & MapBox.

This app uses CoronaAPI and MapBox for plotting Coronavirus Cases On World Map, the data is updated every day.

Case Representation
    1. Red color represents region with > 255 cases
    2. Dark color represents region with < 255 cases.

[CoronaAPI](https://corona-api.com/) provides statistics via REST API from the World Health Organization. This API retrieves data by country including population, the number of cases confirmed, recovered, critical cases, deaths, recovered per death ratio, cases per million population, and more. The data is updated multiple times a day.

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) is a location data platform that powers the maps and location services used in many popular apps.

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Displaying Stats 
   2. Provide more displaying options for the user
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to integrate a API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. I learned about API management and how to implement Mapbox and use it to plot Covid-19 cases.
